 * This stores a contract address -> owner address pair plus the received balance of the owner

 * It's used to optimise checking balances of market orders
 * A token owner could have a lot of different tokens for sale from the same contract
 * It's unnecessary to repeat a balance check, which is quite expensive in terms of list update time
