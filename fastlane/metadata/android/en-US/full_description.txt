Coming soon:

AlphaWallet has comprehensive Ethereum crypto management for most chains, however our main focus is managing and using tokens. The real power of Ethereum is in being able to interact with tokens in an intuitive and simple way. AlphaWallet and TokenScript together are working on the next generation of token usability; unlocking the real power and convenience of tokens. This is what sets us aside from other wallets - we are the wallet for token control and interaction.

Version 3.24 sees our new UX for any blockchain interactions.

We are still open source. Thank you for supporting us and open source projects. We welcome you to check our source code and fork our repo to produce your own wallet and encourage you to create exciting utility tokens powered by TokenScript, in your new wallet or using base AlphaWallet.
