# TokenScript is useful for a supernode

Currently util module is a demonstration that TokenScript can be used for a supernode's data abstraction layer.

A supernode is an Ethereum node that not only service clients enquires about blockchain data, but also enquires about token data.

TokenScript can serve as a data abstraction layer, help a supernode to catch and index token data.

# Run a demonstration

To see how TokenScript extracts TokenData, first download a tokenscript

    $ curl -O http://repo.tokenscript.org/aw.app/2019/10/fifa.tsml
    
Then run `gradle run` in this module. You should see something like this:

````
$ gradle run

> Task :util:run

countryA: "RUS",
countryB: "KSA",
````

Which returned the token data of a token that represents a FIFA ticket. Observe that

````
countryA: "RUS",
countryB: "KSA",
````
Means that this token is for the match Russia vs Saudi Arabia.

Note that this is unlike Token Registries where all ICO projects list their tokens. The token here represents a specific ticket (it has a unique-ID which is `1`) and has to be indexed for search by a supernode's database. If someone wish to purchase a ticket of Russia vs Saudi Arabia this ticket can then in turn be retrieved.

Each token attribute may be sourced from several origins.

- TokenID: a part of tokenID akin to ERC721 is used for the value of some attributes.
- The return value of a call to a smart contract (must be a `view` call).
- An event (Ethereum blockchain event)
- A constant
- A value from an attestation (if the supernode is in possession of such an attestation)
- A trusted 3rd party source (e.g. an HTTPS API's return value)

For example, a FIFA ticket token might have the match encoded in the TokenID. However, some tkoen attributes, like `askPrice`, might be defined in an attestation signed by the seller; another attribute, like `expiry`, might originate from the return value of the smart contract's view function `getExpiry` since the event organiser can define and change the date of the event, and `lastSoldPrice` might originate from an Ethereum blockchain event.
